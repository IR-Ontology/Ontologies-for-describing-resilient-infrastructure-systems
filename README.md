# Ontologies-for-describing-resilient-infrastructure-systems
Ontologies for describing resilient infrastructure systems: underground drainage system, transportation system, building system, and flooding system. 

Considering that the underground drainage system, transportation network, and nearby buildings are susceptible to challenges when urban flooding occurs, included in this scenario are four interlinked sub-ontologies of the underground drainage system ontology (UDSO), transportation system ontology (TSO), building system ontology (BSO), and flooding system ontology (FSO).
